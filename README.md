# Superhero & Vehicles Python Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including:
- Class design
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

## Files
- `superhero.py`: Defines Superhero classes with attributes, methods, and inheritance.
- `vehicles.py`: Defines Vehicle classes (`Car`, `Plane`) with polymorphic `move()` methods.
- `main.py`: Example usage of both Superhero and Vehicle classes.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
